Hello! You're looking at something mildly interesting, I hope.

## Whoami

See, at this point, I'd wish I had a cool mission statement, but I don't. I'm a human being, and I put some stuff on this here page.
I'm obsessed with Linguistics, Critical Thought, and the Future of Computing.
Oh, and I'm a musician. I'm an absolutely insane musician, and, given a melody, maybe I can conjure your wildest dreams, or maybe I can't. Nobody's given me a melody yet :(.

## Not whoami (but also not whoaminot)

Below are my sections, which are not up to date yet:

- [Posts](/posts/)
- [Books](/books/)
- [Unselected](/unselected/)
- [Newpress](/newpress/)

Also here's a rabbit: ![a rabbit](/images/Dino-Bunny.jpg)

### Below this point, you might see a random post. I don't know the significance of why any post shows up at any time, but nonetheless, it's there, not just for you, but for me too.
