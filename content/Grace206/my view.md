#### My view from the end of a warped tunnel.

I sit

I sit at the end of a warped tunnel, in fact!

I’ve primed myself for the dim that comes

when someone sends me sights

which have touched their soul

In the dim darkness,

I become a furnace,

Cold and still nervous

Because without the broken camera of another soul

I’ve become poised to be lost in my own fishbowl

Human interaction as a scoreboard is a cold,

empty, unrealistic reality

Then someone comes, and gives me their soul's little memory card

I steel myself to look at it,

and by the time i really see, they’re gone.

and so the furnace goes on, overheating,

while the mess inside remains broken, shattered, and frozen

bro i literally just need someone to jam a soul camera in my face 24-7

Maybe i need someone else to have my own soul camera

maybe i need to fade into oblivion

being secondary

or not

Something is made of nothing,

but it’s still Kelvin Zero in my soul

and the world burns on around me
